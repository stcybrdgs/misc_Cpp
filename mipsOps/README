THE MIPSOPS PROGRAM

Objective: 
This program demonstrates how the MIPS computer architecture performs integer multiplication and division.

Description: 
This console program simulates the MIPS algorithms for multiplication and division. The user is prompted for two integer operands and to select either multiplication or division. The output is then divided into four columns: one to display the current step in the algorithm, and three to display the state of the bit sequence in each register used by the operation.

Requirements: 
- implement the MIPS multiplication algorithm for integers
- implement the MIPS division algorithm for integers
- prompt the user for the mode of operation (mult or div)
- prompt the user for two operands (entered as integers in base 10)
- display the contents of each register in binary at every step of computation
- format the program output for readability in the console

Note:
The output is formatted for a fairly wide viewing pane, so you may want to adjust your console width to 115 or higher for best results.
