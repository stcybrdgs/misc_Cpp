#THE MIPSOPS PROGRAM

OBJECTIVE: 
This C++ console program demonstrates how the MIPS computer architecture performs integer multiplication and division.

DESCRIPTION: 
The user is prompted for two integer operands and to select either multiplication or division. The console output is then divided into four columns: one to display the current step in the algorithm, and three to display the state of the bit sequence in each register being used by the operation.

REQUIREMENTS: 
- implement the MIPS multiplication algorithm for integers
- implement the MIPS division algorithm for integers
- prompt the user for the mode of operation (mult or div)
- prompt the user for two operands (entered as integers in base 10)
- display the contents of each register in binary at every step of computation
- format the program output for readability in the console

NOTES:
The output is formatted for a fairly wide viewing pane, so you may want to **adjust your console width to 115** or higher for best results.

This program was eventually developed into a full-blown **[web project](https://github.com/stcybrdgs/www.mipsops.com).**
