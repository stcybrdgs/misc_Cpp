PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

Description: 
This console program reads user-input data on how many pounds of food is consumed weekly by the three monkeys at the Taylor zoo. The program also prints a summary tabular report displaying the user data, along with select statistics based on the data.
             
Objective:
This program demonstrates how to use 2-D arrays to process multiple sets of identical data and  how to pass 2-D arrays to functions in C++.

Requirements:
The local zoo has three monkeys and wants to track how many pounds of food each of them eat every day of the week. Write a program that stores the monkey data in a two-dimensional array (3 x 7). Each row represents a monkey, and each column represents a day of the week. The monkey data is captured from the keyboard, and each entry is stored as a floating-point value. The only data validation required is the rejection of negative numbers. 

Once all the data is read from the keyboard, the program should print a formatted report to the screen, including:
- amount of food eaten by each monkey per day
- the average amount of food eaten by all monkeys per day
- the least amount of food eaten on any day by any monkey
- the largest amount of food eaten on any day by any monkey

The program should call a separate function to compute the value for each of the bullets above, as well as a separate function to print the report (5 functions total).
